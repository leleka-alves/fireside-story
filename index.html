    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>and Alessandra, Diego and Ciccio were camping...</p>
    <h3> Suddenly </h3>
    <h6> Someone farts! </h6>
    <h4> "Nossa senhora", <h4>
    <p> Alessandra said, and both her and Diego started </p>
    <p> wondering who the culprit of the fart would be...</p>
    <p> When they least expected, the third member of the group says: </p>
    <p> "Aaaaaaaannnnn... Guys... I am sorry but" </p>
    <p> "I am a little gassy today" </p>
    <p> "Aaaaaannnn... I thing it was the prossequinho I had" </p>
